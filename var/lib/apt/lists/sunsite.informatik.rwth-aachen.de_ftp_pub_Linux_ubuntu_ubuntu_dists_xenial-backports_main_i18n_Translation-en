Package: appstream
Description-md5: 6dd88e1f82260435137249a5504e5e81
Description-en: Software component metadata management
 AppStream is a metadata specification, allowing to write metadata for
 software projects in a standardized format.
 It provides facilities to easily access and transform the data, as well
 as a few additional services to allow building feature-rich software center
 applications.
 .
 This package provides tools to generate, maintain and query the AppStream
 data pool of installed and available software, and enables integration
 with the APT package manager.
 .
 The 'appstreamcli' tool can be used for accessing the software component
 pool as well as for working with AppStream metadata directly, including
 validating it for compliance with the specification.

Package: appstream-doc

Description-en: Developer documentation for AppStream
 AppStream is a metadata specification, allowing to write metadata for
 software projects in a general-purpose format. This allows software centers
 to display useful information for not installed software, as well as
 determining software the user might want to install (e.g. to open an
 unknown file type or to make missing firmware available).
 .
 This package provides developer documentation for AppStream.

Package: autopkgtest
Description-md5: 31d9217a487d44cfd80f0588068648cd
Description-en: automatic as-installed testing for Debian packages
 autopkgtest runs tests on binary packages.  The tests are run on the
 package as installed on a testbed system (which may be found via a
 virtualisation or containment system).  The tests are expected to be
 supplied in the corresponding Debian source package.
 .
 See autopkgtest(1) and /usr/share/doc/autopkgtest.
 Depending on which virtualization server you want to use, you need to
 install additional packages (schroot, lxc, lxd, or qemu-system)
 .
 For generating tests of well-known source packages such as Perl and Ruby
 libraries you should install the autodep8 package.

Package: debhelper
Description-md5: c3d35229c1ce392f77324206e097b92e
Description-en: helper programs for debian/rules
 A collection of programs that can be used in a debian/rules file to
 automate common tasks related to building Debian packages. Programs
 are included to install various files into your package, compress
 files, fix file permissions, integrate your package with the Debian
 menu system, debconf, doc-base, etc. Most Debian packages use debhelper
 as part of their build process.

Package: dh-autoreconf
Description-md5: 64431da0ae4318a5fbf441743bd5ffc5
Description-en: debhelper add-on to call autoreconf and clean up after the build
 dh-autoreconf provides a debhelper sequence addon named 'autoreconf' and two
 commands, dh_autoreconf and dh_autoreconf_clean.
 .
 The dh_autoreconf command creates a list of the files and their checksums,
 calls autoreconf and then creates a second list for the new files.
 .
 The dh_autoreconf_clean command compares these two lists and removes all
 files which have been added or changed (files may be excluded if needed).
 .
 For CDBS users, a rule is provided to call the dh-autoreconf programs at
 the right time.

Package: libarchive-dev
Description-md5: 4fedaf2f347af4287edce946b56ba586
Description-en: Multi-format archive and compression library (development files)
 The libarchive library provides a flexible interface for reading and writing
 archives in various formats such as tar and cpio. libarchive also supports
 reading and writing archives compressed using various compression filters such
 as gzip and bzip2. The library is inherently stream-oriented; readers serially
 iterate through the archive, writers serially add things to the archive.
 .
 Archive formats supported are:
 .
    * tar (read and write, including GNU extensions)
    * pax (read and write, including GNU and star extensions)
    * cpio (read and write, including odc and newc variants)
    * iso9660 (read and write, including Joliet and Rockridge extensions, with
      some limitations)
    * zip (read only, with some limitations, uses zlib)
    * mtree (read and write)
    * shar (write only)
    * ar (read and write, including BSD and GNU/SysV variants)
    * empty (read only; in particular, note that no other format will accept an
      empty file)
    * raw (read only)
    * xar (read only)
    * rar (read only, with some limitations)
    * 7zip (read and write, with some limitations)
 .
 Filters supported are:
 .
    * gzip (read and write, uses zlib)
    * bzip2 (read and write, uses bzlib)
    * compress (read and write, uses an internal implementation)
    * uudecode (read only)
    * separate command-line compressors with fixed-signature auto-detection
    * xz and lzma (read and write using liblzma)
 .
 This package provides the files necessary for development with libarchive.

Package: libarchive-tools
Description-md5: 04bbebb441868f4c976e664833572c46
Description-en: FreeBSD implementations of 'tar' and 'cpio' and other archive tools
 This package contains several command-line tools based on the libarchive
 library.
 .
 The bsdtar program is the default system 'tar' program used on FreeBSD. bsdtar
 uses the libarchive library as a backend which does all of the work for reading
 and writing archives in various formats.
 .
 The bsdcpio program is the default system 'cpio' program used on FreeBSD.
 bsdcpio uses the libarchive library as a backend which does all of the work for
 reading and writing archives in various formats.
 .
 The bsdcat program reads archived data from files or from its standard input
 and uses the libarchive library to decompresses it to its standard output.
 It may be used for viewing the contents of archives or for passing it to other
 tools for further processing.
