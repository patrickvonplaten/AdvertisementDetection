Package: nvidia-settings
Description-md5: 9bb7c34dc84550e6fff415c0eb0eda37
Description-en: Tool for configuring the NVIDIA graphics driver
 The nvidia-settings utility is a tool for configuring the NVIDIA
 Linux graphics driver.  It operates by communicating with the NVIDIA
 X driver, querying and updating state as appropriate.  This
 communication is done with the NV-CONTROL X extension.
 .
 Values such as brightness and gamma, XVideo attributes, temperature,
 and OpenGL settings can be queried and configured via nvidia-settings.

Package: bumblebee
Description-md5: 603c350e38f498eb44849c8eb81822e8
Description-en: NVIDIA Optimus support for Linux
 Bumblebee is an effort to make NVIDIA Optimus enabled laptops work in
 GNU/Linux systems. These laptops are built in such a way that the NVIDIA
 graphics card can be used on demand so that battery life is improved and
 temperature is kept low.
 .
 It disables the discrete graphics card if no client is detected, and starts
 an X server making use of NVIDIA card if requested then let software GL
 implementations (such as VirtualGL) copy frames to the visible display that
 runs on the integrated graphics. The ability to use discrete graphics
 depends on the driver: open source nouveau and proprietary nvidia.

Package: bumblebee-nvidia
