Title: The preview Package for LaTeX
Author: David Kastrup
Abstract: The main purpose of this package is the extraction of certain
 environments (most notably displayed formulas) from LaTeX sources as graphics.
 This works with DVI files postprocessed by either Dvips and Ghostscript or
 dvipng, but it also works when you are using PDFTeX for generating PDF files
 (usually also postprocessed by Ghostscript).
 .
 Current uses of the package include the preview-latex package for WYSIWYG
 functionality in the AUCTeX editing environment, generation of previews in
 LyX, as part of the operation of the ps4pdf package, the tbook XML system and
 some other tools.
