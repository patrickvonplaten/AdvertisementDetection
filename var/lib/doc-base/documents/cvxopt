Title: CvxOpt: Python Package for Convex Optimization
Author: Joachim Dahl, Lieven Vandenberghe
Abstract: CVXOPT is a Python package for convex optimization.
 It includes Python classes for storing and manipulating
 dense and sparse matrices, an interface to most of the
 double-precision real and complex BLAS, an interface to the
 dense linear equation solvers and eigenvalue routines from
 LAPACK, interfaces to the sparse LU and Cholesky solvers
 from UMFPACK and CHOLMOD, routines for solving convex
 optimization problems, an interface to the linear
 programming solver in GLPK, and interfaces to the linear and
 quadratic programming solvers in MOSEK and a a modeling tool
 for specifying convex piecewise-linear optimization
 problems.
