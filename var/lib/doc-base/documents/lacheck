Title: LaCheck: A consistency checker for LaTeX documents
Author: Kresten Krab Thorup, Per Abrahamsen
Abstract: LaCheck is a general purpose consistency checker for LaTeX
 documents.  It reads a LaTeX document and displays warning messages, if it
 finds bad sequences. It should be noted, that the badness is very subjective.
 LaCheck is designed to help find common mistakes in LaTeX documents,
 especially those made by beginners.
