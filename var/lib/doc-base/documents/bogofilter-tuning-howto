Title: Tuning Bogofilter's Robinson-Fisher Method -- An Updated HOWTO
Author: Greg Louis
Abstract: Bogotune is a tool (shipped with bogofilter) that automates the
 tuning process. Its "full search" mode performs a five-dimensional grid
 search over possible values of the parameters to be described in this howto,
 and comes up with recommendations for optimal settings. There's also a
 "partial search" mode that is only three-dimensional. If you have enough spam
 and nonspam messages (at least 2,500 of each), using bogotune is highly
 recommended for optimizing bogofilter's accuracy.
