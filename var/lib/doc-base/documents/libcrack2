Title: cracklib2 - a pro-active password checker library
Author: Jean Pierre LeJacq
Abstract: cracklib is a library containing a C function which may be used in
 a passwd like program.  The idea is simple: try to prevent users from
 choosing passwords that could be guessed by crack by filtering them
 out, at source. cracklib is NOT a replacement passwd program.
 cracklib is a LIBRARY.
